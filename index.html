      <p>
      I am computer engineering student with a passion for defense and
      security. This summer, I will be working as an intern in the Electronic
      Warefare department at the Naval Surface Warefare Center in Crane, Indiana.
      During my time there, I hope to work on projects that can change the lives
      of those who serve while learning all that I can.
      </p>
      <p>
      During my free time, I like to lift weights and play baseball. I'm currently a
      captain on the Illinois Tech baseball team, and am hoping to have a great
      upcoming season.
