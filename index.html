        My name is Brandon Bennitt and I am currently a sophomore computer
        engineering student at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a
        passion for defense and security. This summer, I will be working as an
        intern in the Electronic Warefare department at the Naval Surface
        Warefare Center in Crane, Indiana. During my time there, I hope to work
        on projects that can change the lives of those who serve while learning
        all that I can.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Once I graduate IIT, I hope to be working full time at the Naval Surface
          Warefare Center or at a different military contractor that supports the
          same mission: to help protect those who serve.

        <p>
          During my free time, I like to lift weights and play baseball. I'm currently a
          captain on the Illinois Tech baseball team, and am hoping to have a great
          upcoming season.

        <h5>Education</h5>
        <p>
          As of right now, I plan on obtaining a co-terminal master's degree in computer
          science with a specialization in information security. I hope obtaining this
          degree allows me to learn more about the cyber security industry so I can be an
          expert in the field.
